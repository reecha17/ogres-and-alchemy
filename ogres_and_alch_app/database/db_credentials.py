# To actually have your app use this file, you need to RENAME the file to db_credentials.py
# You will find details about your CS340 database credentials on Canvas.

# the following will be used by the webapp.py to interact with the database
# You can also use environment variables

# For Local Devlelopment
# host = 'localhost'
# user = 'root'                                   # can be different if you set up another username in your MySQL installation
# passwd = 'mysql_password'                       # set accordingly
# db = 'oanda'


# For OSU Flip Servers

# host =       # MUST BE THIS
# user =       # don't forget the cs340_ prefix
# passwd =               # should only be 4 digits if default
# db =
